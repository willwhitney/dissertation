  abstract	= {There exist a number of reinforcement learning algorithms
		  which learn by climbing the gradient of expected reward.
		  Their long-run convergence has been proved, even in
		  partially observable environments with non-deterministic
		  actions, and without the need for a system model. However,
		  the variance of the gradient estimator has been found to be
		  a significant practical problem. Recent approaches have
		  discounted future rewards, introducing a bias-variance
		  trade-off into the gradient estimate. We incorporate a
		  reward baseline into the learning system, and show that it
		  affects variance without introducing further bias. In
		  particular, as we approach the zerobias, high-variance
		  parametedzation, the optimal (or variance minimizing)
		  constant reward baseline is equal to the long-term average
		  expected reward. Modified policy-gradient algorithms are
		  presented, and a number of experiments demonstrate their
		  improvement over previous work.},
